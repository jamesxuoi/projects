# Welcome to James Repository

My name is James Xuoi. Iâ€™m a Hardware Engineer, who has big passion with Machine learning algorithms and Cloud architect.

I love the idea of building an end to end tinyML (embedded hardware with built-in machine learning models) project from pcb design to deploying the optimised machine learning model into production (eg. ML software, AI embedded systems devices). Therefore, I started to work as a full-time Hardware and Machine Learning Engineer in medical field.

Beside working, I frequently attend various Hackathon events to enhance my programming skills as well as to learn from talented engineers that work at Top Tech companies (eg. FAANG). In return, I also love helping others, therefore I created this repository in order to share all my hands-on projects of web scraping, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, web app and desktop app development and I hope that this could help enhancing your programming skills. 

I hope you enjoy the materials!

## Projects

I have listed my projects in most recent order. If you are beginner with zero programming skill. Please start from the bottom to the top.

### [Image Detection with YOLO](https://github.com/jamesxuoi/projects/tree/master/projects/Image%20detection%20YOLO)

This project will help you to understand and get skilled at image processing and video processing with YOLO and OpenCV. Below is the result of the final product, which is detecting objects in a car racing video by a script running on Atom IDE.
