# Welcome to Python Developer Repository

My name is James Xuoi. Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Software Developer and Data Science Trainer, who has been working in AI, Data Science and Software development for almost 2 years.

I love the idea of building an end to end AI project from data mining to deploying the optimised machine learning model into production (eg. ML software, AI embedded systems). Therefore, I started to work as a full-time Machine Learning Engineer and part-time Software Developer for multiple tech startups.

Beside working, I frequently attend various Hackathon events to enhance my programming skills as well as to learn from talented engineers that work at Top Tech companies (eg. FAANG). In return, I also love helping others, therefore I created this repository in order to share all my hands-on projects of web scraping, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, web app and desktop app development in Python and I hope that this could help enhancing your programming skills. You can find detail of instructions for each project at the [Python Developer Blog](https://jamesxuoi.github.io). 

I hope you enjoy the materials!

## Projects

I have listed my projects in most recent order. If you are beginner with zero programming skill. Please start from the bottom to the top.

### [Image Detection with YOLO](https://github.com/jamesxuoi/projects/tree/master/projects/Image%20detection%20YOLO)

This project will help you to understand and get skilled at image processing and video processing with YOLO and OpenCV. Below is the result of the final product, which is detecting objects in a car racing video by a script running on Atom IDE.
