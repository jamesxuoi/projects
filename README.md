# Welcome to Python Developer Repository

My name is James Xuoi. Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Software Developer and Data Science Trainer, who has been working in AI, Data Science and Software development for almost 2 years.

I love the idea of building an end to end AI project from data mining to deploying the optimised machine learning model into production (eg. ML software, AI embedded systems). Therefore, I started to work as a full-time Machine Learning Engineer and part-time Software Developer for multiple tech startups.

Beside working, I frequently attend various Hackathon events to enhance my programming skills as well as to learn from talented engineers that work at Top Tech companies (eg. FAANG). In return, I also love helping others, therefore I created this repository in order to share all my hands-on projects of web scraping, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, web app and desktop app development in Python and I hope that this could help enhancing your programming skills. You can find detail of instructions for each project at the [Python Developer Blog](https://jamesxuoi.github.io). 

I hope you enjoy the materials!
